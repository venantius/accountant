# Accountant

Accountant is a ClojureScript library to make navigation in single-page
applications simple. It expects you to use [Secretary 2](https://github.com/gf3/secretary/tree/v2.0.0) to define your routes.

By default, clicking a link in a ClojureScript application that isn't a simple
URL fragment will trigger a full page reload. This defeats the purpose of using
such elegant frameworks as Om, Reagent, et al.

With Accountant, links that correspond to defined Secretary routes will trigger
dispatches to those routes and update the browser's path, but won't reload the
page.

Accountant also lets you navigate the app to a new URL directly, rather than through
`<a>` tags.

Be aware that Accountant relies on the browser's HTML5 history, so older
browsers will be left behind.

## Installation

Just add the following to your `project.clj`:

```clojure
:dependencies [venantius/accountant "0.2-SNAPSHOT"]
```

## Usage

When you configure secretary 2 you create a url dispatcher like this:

```clojure
(ns your-app-ns
  (:require [secretary.core :as secretary :refer-macros [defroute]]
            [accountant.core :as accountant]))

(defroute home-route "/" {:as params}
  ...)

(defroute user-route "/user" {:as params}
  ...)

(def secretary-dispatcher
  (secretary/uri-dispatcher [home-route
                             user-route]))
```

Also you need a list of all the handled paths:

```clojure
(def routes-stack [
  "/"       ; route used in home-route
  "/user"   ; route used in user-route
])
```

At this point you can configure accountant:

```clojure
(accountant/configure-navigation! secretary-dispatcher routes-stack)
```

...and you're good to go!

You can also use Accountant to set the current path in the browser, e.g.

```clojure
(accountant/navigate! "/foo/bar/baz")
```

If you want to dispatch the current path, just call this function:

```clojure
(accountant/dispatch-current! secretary-dispatcher)
```

If you do not set the _href_ of an anchor tag accountant won't do anything, this is used when the action is handled with onClick.

```html
<a onClick="doSomething();">Home</a>
```
